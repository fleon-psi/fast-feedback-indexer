On one hand, contributions are very welcome, just contact hans-christian.stadler@psi.ch to talk about forms of collaboration.
On the other hand, the code has a clearly defined purpose that probably makes contributing a bit inflexible: it has to run in production for fast feedback at PSI beamlines.

Very welcome in any case:
- security fixes and enhancements
- bug fixes
- better tests
- better documentation
- cleaner code and clearer code structure
- speed improvements
- better and new language bindings
- better and new integrations into software pipelines
- better and new packaging methods

If you're unsure, just get in contact,
HC
