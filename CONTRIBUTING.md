On one hand, contributions are very welcome - just contact hans-christian.stadler@psi.ch, and we can discuss forms of collaboration.
On the other hand the code has a clearly defined purpose, which probably makes contributing a bit inflexible: this code is supposed to run for fast feedback in production settings at PSI beamlines.

Very welcome in any case:
- security enhancements
- cleaner code structure
- better documentation
- speed improvements
- better Python bindings and bindings for other languages such as Julia or Rust
- better or alternative packaging methods

If unsure, just get in contact anyway,
HC
